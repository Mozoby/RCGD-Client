# RCGD-Client
Remote Control Ground Drone

This project was created as a part of LA Hacks 2015. We successfully turned a cheap remote control car into an unlimited range ground drone.

It is a node.js client for using an xbox controller on the client machine and receiving streaming video.

The node.js program hosts a web page with jwplayer, which streams from the ground drone.

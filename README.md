# RCGD-Client
Remote Control Ground Drone Client

This is a node client app for controlling the RCGD. It supports driving the drone with an xbox controller plugged into your local computer, and streaming live video from the drone.

## What is RCGD?
RCGD is an unlimited range ground drone constructed from a cheap remote control car.

We replaced the electronics with an Intel Edison, mounted a phone on the car, and used these systems to control it:
